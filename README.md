The EtMDB API allows you to manage resources within the Database in a simple, programmatic way using 
HTTP requests. The endpoints are intuitive and powerful, allowing you to easily make calls 
to retrieve information or to execute actions directly accessing the database.
                                                                                                 
The API Documentation is created using Django Rest Framework and Swagger/OpenAPI method. 
All of the functionality that you are familiar with in the EtMDB website is also available 
through the API, allowing you to script the complex actions that your situation requires.
The API documentation supports generating human-friendly HTML output for each resource when 
the HTML format is requested. These pages allow for easy browsing of resources, as well as 
forms for submitting data to the resources using the HTTP request methods. The API has two 
JSON or XML formatting.
